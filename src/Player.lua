    Player Class

    The Player is a ship that remains at the very bottom of the screen, facing toward
    the top, the same direction they can fire bullets to hit Aliens. The Player starts
    with three lives; upon colliding with an enemy or their bullets, the Player will
    lose a life and restart the level. Game over is reached when all lives are depleted.
