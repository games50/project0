## Feedback

Hey Dustin, I can't add feedback via the usual method, so I'm adding it here as a README.md.

Overall:

- Good effort!

- Github can be a pain to work with at first so I totally understand!

-----
Design:

- Be wary of allowing players complete vertical motion as well as horizontal, generally not a feature in a game like this

-----
Correctness:

- Technically, the spec requires that you be able to defeat waves of enemies, which on playthrough was not possible, so be aware of that
